Maximum Flow
Just as we can model a road map as a directed graph in order to ﬁnd the shortest
path from one point to another, we can also interpret a directed graph as a “ﬂow
network” and use it to answer questions about material ﬂows. Imagine a mate-
rial coursing through a system from a source, where the material is produced, to
a sink, where it is consumed. The source produces the material at some steady
rate, and the sink consumes the material at the same rate. The “ﬂow” of the mate-
rial at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves.
Flow networks can model many problems, including liquids ﬂowing through pipes,
parts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, and information
through communication networks.
We can think of each directed edge in a ﬂow network as a conduit for the mate-
rial. Each conduit has a stated capacity, given as a maximum rate at which the ma-
terial can ﬂow through the conduit, such as 200 gallons of liquid per hour through
a pipe or 20 amperes of electrical current through a wire. Vertices are conduit
junctions, and other than the source and sink, material ﬂows through the vertices
without collecting in them. In other words, the rate at which material enters a ver-
tex must equal the rate at which it leaves the vertex. We call this property “ﬂow
conservation,” and it is equivalent to Kirchhoff’s current law when the material is
electrical current.
In the maximum-ﬂow problem, we wish to compute the greatest rate at which
we can ship material from the source to the sink without violating any capacity
constraints. It is one of the simplest problems concerning ﬂow networks and, as
we shall see in this chapter, this problem can be solved by efﬁcient algorithms.
Moreover, we can adapt the basic techniques used in maximum-ﬂow algorithms to
solve other network-ﬂow problems.
This chapter presents two general methods for solving the maximum-ﬂow prob-
lem. Section 26.1 formalizes the notions of ﬂow networks and ﬂows, formally
deﬁning the maximum-ﬂow problem. Section 26.2 describes the classical method
of Ford and Fulkerson for ﬁnding maximum ﬂows. An application of this method,

ﬁnding a maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph, appears in Sec-
tion 26.3. Section 26.4 presents the push-relabel method, which underlies many of
the fastest algorithms for network-ﬂow problems. Section 26.5 covers the “relabel-
to-front” algorithm, a particular implementation of the push-relabel method that
runs in time O.V 3/. Although this algorithm is not the fastest algorithm known,
it illustrates some of the techniques used in the asymptotically fastest algorithms,
and it is reasonably efﬁcient in practice.
26.1
Flow networks
In this section, we give a graph-theoretic deﬁnition of ﬂow networks, discuss their
properties, and deﬁne the maximum-ﬂow problem precisely. We also introduce
some helpful notation.
Flow networks and ﬂows
A ﬂow network G D .V; E/ is a directed graph in which each edge .u; / 2 E
has a nonnegative capacity c.u; /  0. We further require that if E contains an
edge .u; /, then there is no edge .; u/ in the reverse direction. (We shall see
shortly how to work around this restriction.) If .u; / 62 E, then for convenience
we deﬁne c.u; / D 0, and we disallow self-loops. We distinguish two vertices
in a ﬂow network: a source s and a sink t. For convenience, we assume that each
vertex lies on some path from the source to the sink. That is, for each vertex  2 V ,
the ﬂow network contains a path s ;  ; t. The graph is therefore connected
and, since each vertex other than s has at least one entering edge, jEj  jV j  1.
Figure 26.1 shows an example of a ﬂow network.
We are now ready to deﬁne ﬂows more formally. Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow
network with a capacity function c. Let s be the source of the network, and let t be
the sink. A ﬂow in G is a real-valued function f W V 	 V ! R that satisﬁes the
following two properties:
Capacity constraint: For all u;  2 V , we require 0  f .u; /  c.u; /.
Flow conservation: For all u 2 V  fs; tg, we require
X
2V
f .; u/ D
X
2V
f .u; / :
When .u; / 62 E, there can be no ﬂow from u to , and f .u; / D 0.

The Vancouver factory is the source s, and the Winnipeg warehouse is the sink t. The company ships
pucks through intermediate cities, but only c.u; / crates per day can go from city u to city . Each
edge is labeled with its capacity. (b) A ﬂow f in G with value jf j D 19. Each edge .u; / is labeled

that is, the total ﬂow out of the source minus the ﬂow into the source. (Here, the jj
notation denotes ﬂow value, not absolute value or cardinality.) Typically, a ﬂow
network will not have any edges into the source, and the ﬂow into the source, given
by the summation P
2V f .; s/, will be 0. We include it, however, because when
we introduce residual networks later in this chapter, the ﬂow into the source will
become signiﬁcant. In the maximum-ﬂow problem, we are given a ﬂow network G
with source s and sink t, and we wish to ﬁnd a ﬂow of maximum value.
Before seeing an example of a network-ﬂow problem, let us brieﬂy explore the
deﬁnition of ﬂow and the two ﬂow properties. The capacity constraint simply
says that the ﬂow from one vertex to another must be nonnegative and must not
exceed the given capacity. The ﬂow-conservation property says that the total ﬂow
into a vertex other than the source or sink must equal the total ﬂow out of that
vertex—informally, “ﬂow in equals ﬂow out.”
An example of ﬂow
A ﬂow network can model the trucking problem shown in Figure 26.1(a). The
Lucky Puck Company has a factory (source s) in Vancouver that manufactures
hockey pucks, and it has a warehouse (sink t) in Winnipeg that stocks them. Lucky

Figure 26.2
Converting a network with antiparallel edges to an equivalent one with no antiparallel
edges. (a) A ﬂow network containing both the edges .1; 2/ and .2; 1/. (b) An equivalent network
with no antiparallel edges. We add the new vertex 0, and we replace edge .1; 2/ by the pair of
edges .1; 0/ and .0; 2/, both with the same capacity as .1; 2/.
Puck leases space on trucks from another ﬁrm to ship the pucks from the factory
to the warehouse. Because the trucks travel over speciﬁed routes (edges) between
cities (vertices) and have a limited capacity, Lucky Puck can ship at most c.u; /
crates per day between each pair of cities u and  in Figure 26.1(a). Lucky Puck
has no control over these routes and capacities, and so the company cannot alter
the ﬂow network shown in Figure 26.1(a). They need to determine the largest
number p of crates per day that they can ship and then to produce this amount, since
there is no point in producing more pucks than they can ship to their warehouse.
Lucky Puck is not concerned with how long it takes for a given puck to get from
the factory to the warehouse; they care only that p crates per day leave the factory
and p crates per day arrive at the warehouse.
We can model the “ﬂow” of shipments with a ﬂow in this network because the
number of crates shipped per day from one city to another is subject to a capacity
constraint. Additionally, the model must obey ﬂow conservation, for in a steady
state, the rate at which pucks enter an intermediate city must equal the rate at which
they leave. Otherwise, crates would accumulate at intermediate cities.
Modeling problems with antiparallel edges
Suppose that the trucking ﬁrm offered Lucky Puck the opportunity to lease space
for 10 crates in trucks going from Edmonton to Calgary. It would seem natural to
add this opportunity to our example and form the network shown in Figure 26.2(a).
This network suffers from one problem, however: it violates our original assump-
tion that if an edge .1; 2/ 2 E, then .2; 1/ 62 E. We call the two edges .1; 2/
and .2; 1/ antiparallel. Thus, if we wish to model a ﬂow problem with antipar-
allel edges, we must transform the network into an equivalent one containing no

712
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
antiparallel edges. Figure 26.2(b) displays this equivalent network. We choose
one of the two antiparallel edges, in this case .1; 2/, and split it by adding a new
vertex 0 and replacing edge .1; 2/ with the pair of edges .1; 0/ and .0; 2/.
We also set the capacity of both new edges to the capacity of the original edge.
The resulting network satisﬁes the property that if an edge is in the network, the
reverse edge is not. Exercise 26.1-1 asks you to prove that the resulting network is
equivalent to the original one.
Thus, we see that a real-world ﬂow problem might be most naturally modeled
by a network with antiparallel edges. It will be convenient to disallow antipar-
allel edges, however, and so we have a straightforward way to convert a network
containing antiparallel edges into an equivalent one with no antiparallel edges.
Networks with multiple sources and sinks
A maximum-ﬂow problem may have several sources and sinks, rather than just
one of each. The Lucky Puck Company, for example, might actually have a set
of m factories fs1; s2; : : : ; smg and a set of n warehouses ft1; t2; : : : ; tng, as shown
in Figure 26.3(a). Fortunately, this problem is no harder than ordinary maximum
ﬂow.
We can reduce the problem of determining a maximum ﬂow in a network with
multiple sources and multiple sinks to an ordinary maximum-ﬂow problem. Fig-
ure 26.3(b) shows how to convert the network from (a) to an ordinary ﬂow network
with only a single source and a single sink. We add a supersource s and add a
directed edge .s; si/ with capacity c.s; si/ D 1 for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; m. We also
create a new supersink t and add a directed edge .ti; t/ with capacity c.ti; t/ D 1
for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Intuitively, any ﬂow in the network in (a) corresponds to
a ﬂow in the network in (b), and vice versa. The single source s simply provides
as much ﬂow as desired for the multiple sources si, and the single sink t likewise
consumes as much ﬂow as desired for the multiple sinks ti. Exercise 26.1-2 asks
you to prove formally that the two problems are equivalent.

Show that splitting an edge in a ﬂow network yields an equivalent network. More
formally, suppose that ﬂow network G contains edge .u; /, and we create a new
ﬂow network G0 by creating a new vertex x and replacing .u; / by new edges
.u; x/ and .x; / with c.u; x/ D c.x; / D c.u; /. Show that a maximum ﬂow
in G0 has the same value as a maximum ﬂow in G.

The Ford-Fulkerson method
This section presents the Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the maximum-ﬂow
problem. We call it a “method” rather than an “algorithm” because it encompasses
several implementations with differing running times. The Ford-Fulkerson method
depends on three important ideas that transcend the method and are relevant to
many ﬂow algorithms and problems: residual networks, augmenting paths, and
cuts. These ideas are essential to the important max-ﬂow min-cut theorem (The-
orem 26.6), which characterizes the value of a maximum ﬂow in terms of cuts of

26.2
The Ford-Fulkerson method

the ﬂow network. We end this section by presenting one speciﬁc implementation
of the Ford-Fulkerson method and analyzing its running time.
The Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively increases the value of the ﬂow. We start
with f .u; / D 0 for all u;  2 V , giving an initial ﬂow of value 0. At each
iteration, we increase the ﬂow value in G by ﬁnding an “augmenting path” in an
associated “residual network” Gf . Once we know the edges of an augmenting
path in Gf , we can easily identify speciﬁc edges in G for which we can change
the ﬂow so that we increase the value of the ﬂow. Although each iteration of the
Ford-Fulkerson method increases the value of the ﬂow, we shall see that the ﬂow
on any particular edge of G may increase or decrease; decreasing the ﬂow on some
edges may be necessary in order to enable an algorithm to send more ﬂow from the
source to the sink. We repeatedly augment the ﬂow until the residual network has
no more augmenting paths. The max-ﬂow min-cut theorem will show that upon
termination, this process yields a maximum ﬂow.

In order to implement and analyze the Ford-Fulkerson method, we need to intro-
duce several additional concepts.
Residual networks
Intuitively, given a ﬂow network G and a ﬂow f , the residual network Gf consists
of edges with capacities that represent how we can change the ﬂow on edges of G.
An edge of the ﬂow network can admit an amount of additional ﬂow equal to the
edge’s capacity minus the ﬂow on that edge. If that value is positive, we place
that edge into Gf with a “residual capacity” of cf .u; / D c.u; /  f .u; /.
The only edges of G that are in Gf are those that can admit more ﬂow; those
edges .u; / whose ﬂow equals their capacity have cf .u; / D 0, and they are not
in Gf .
The residual network Gf may also contain edges that are not in G, however.
As an algorithm manipulates the ﬂow, with the goal of increasing the total ﬂow, it
might need to decrease the ﬂow on a particular edge. In order to represent a pos-
sible decrease of a positive ﬂow f .u; / on an edge in G, we place an edge .; u/
into Gf with residual capacity cf .; u/ D f .u; /—that is, an edge that can admit
ﬂow in the opposite direction to .u; /, at most canceling out the ﬂow on .u; /.
These reverse edges in the residual network allow an algorithm to send back ﬂow

716
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
it has already sent along an edge. Sending ﬂow back along an edge is equiva-
lent to decreasing the ﬂow on the edge, which is a necessary operation in many
algorithms.
More formally, suppose that we have a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with source s
and sink t. Let f be a ﬂow in G, and consider a pair of vertices u;  2 V . We
deﬁne the residual capacity cf .u; / by
cf .u; / D

if .u; / 2 E ;
f .; u/
if .; u/ 2 E ;
0
otherwise :
(26.2)
Because of our assumption that .u; / 2 E implies .; u/ 62 E, exactly one case in
equation (26.2) applies to each ordered pair of vertices.
As an example of equation (26.2), if c.u; / D 16 and f .u; / D 11, then we
can increase f .u; / by up to cf .u; / D 5 units before we exceed the capacity
constraint on edge .u; /. We also wish to allow an algorithm to return up to 11
units of ﬂow from  to u, and hence cf .; u/ D 11.
Given a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ and a ﬂow f , the residual network of G
induced by f is Gf D .V; Ef /, where
Ef D f.u; / 2 V 	 V W cf .u; / > 0g :
(26.3)
That is, as promised above, each edge of the residual network, or residual edge,
can admit a ﬂow that is greater than 0. Figure 26.4(a) repeats the ﬂow network G
and ﬂow f of Figure 26.1(b), and Figure 26.4(b) shows the corresponding residual
network Gf . The edges in Ef are either edges in E or their reversals, and thus
jEf j  2 jEj :
Observe that the residual network Gf is similar to a ﬂow network with capacities
given by cf . It does not satisfy our deﬁnition of a ﬂow network because it may
contain both an edge .u; / and its reversal .; u/. Other than this difference, a
residual network has the same properties as a ﬂow network, and we can deﬁne a
ﬂow in the residual network as one that satisﬁes the deﬁnition of a ﬂow, but with
respect to capacities cf in the network Gf .
A ﬂow in a residual network provides a roadmap for adding ﬂow to the original
ﬂow network. If f is a ﬂow in G and f 0 is a ﬂow in the corresponding residual
network Gf , we deﬁne f " f 0, the augmentation of ﬂow f by f 0, to be a function
from V 	 V to R, deﬁned by

of this section. (c) The ﬂow in G that results from augmenting along path p by its residual capacity 4.
Edges carrying no ﬂow, such as .3; 2/, are labeled only by their capacity, another convention we
follow throughout. (d) The residual network induced by the ﬂow in (c).
The intuition behind this deﬁnition follows the deﬁnition of the residual network.
We increase the ﬂow on .u; / by f 0.u; / but decrease it by f 0.; u/ because
pushing ﬂow on the reverse edge in the residual network signiﬁes decreasing the
ﬂow in the original network. Pushing ﬂow on the reverse edge in the residual
network is also known as cancellation. For example, if we send 5 crates of hockey
pucks from u to  and send 2 crates from  to u, we could equivalently (from the
perspective of the ﬁnal result) just send 3 creates from u to  and none from  to u.
Cancellation of this type is crucial for any maximum-ﬂow algorithm.
Lemma 26.1
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, and let f be a ﬂow
in G. Let Gf be the residual network of G induced by f , and let f 0 be a ﬂow
in Gf . Then the function f " f 0 deﬁned in equation (26.4) is a ﬂow in G with
value jf " f 0j D jf j C jf 0j.
Proof
We ﬁrst verify that f " f 0 obeys the capacity constraint for each edge in E
and ﬂow conservation at each vertex in V  fs; tg.

Augmenting paths
Given a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ and a ﬂow f , an augmenting path p is a
simple path from s to t in the residual network Gf . By the deﬁnition of the resid-
ual network, we may increase the ﬂow on an edge .u; / of an augmenting path
by up to cf .u; / without violating the capacity constraint on whichever of .u; /
and .; u/ is in the original ﬂow network G.
The shaded path in Figure 26.4(b) is an augmenting path. Treating the residual
network Gf in the ﬁgure as a ﬂow network, we can increase the ﬂow through each
edge of this path by up to 4 units without violating a capacity constraint, since the
smallest residual capacity on this path is cf .2; 3/ D 4. We call the maximum
amount by which we can increase the ﬂow on each edge in an augmenting path p
the residual capacity of p, given by
cf .p/ D min fcf .u; / W .u; / is on pg :

The following lemma, whose proof we leave as Exercise 26.2-7, makes the above
argument more precise.

path in Gf . Deﬁne a function fp W V 	 V ! R by

otherwise :
(26.8)
Then, fp is a ﬂow in Gf with value jfpj D cf .p/ > 0.
The following corollary shows that if we augment f by fp, we get another ﬂow
in G whose value is closer to the maximum. Figure 26.4(c) shows the result of
augmenting the ﬂow f from Figure 26.4(a) by the ﬂow fp in Figure 26.4(b), and
Figure 26.4(d) shows the ensuing residual network.
Corollary 26.3
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network, let f be a ﬂow in G, and let p be an
augmenting path in Gf . Let fp be deﬁned as in equation (26.8), and suppose
that we augment f by fp. Then the function f " fp is a ﬂow in G with value
jf " fpj D jf j C jfpj > jf j.
Proof
Immediate from Lemmas 26.1 and 26.2.
Cuts of ﬂow networks
The Ford-Fulkerson method repeatedly augments the ﬂow along augmenting paths
until it has found a maximum ﬂow. How do we know that when the algorithm
terminates, we have actually found a maximum ﬂow? The max-ﬂow min-cut theo-
rem, which we shall prove shortly, tells us that a ﬂow is maximum if and only if its
residual network contains no augmenting path. To prove this theorem, though, we
must ﬁrst explore the notion of a cut of a ﬂow network.
A cut .S; T / of ﬂow network G D .V; E/ is a partition of V into S and
T D V  S such that s 2 S and t 2 T . (This deﬁnition is similar to the def-
inition of “cut” that we used for minimum spanning trees in Chapter 23, except
that here we are cutting a directed graph rather than an undirected graph, and we
insist that s 2 S and t 2 T .) If f is a ﬂow, then the net ﬂow f .S; T / across the
cut .S; T / is deﬁned to be

(26.10)
A minimum cut of a network is a cut whose capacity is minimum over all cuts of
the network.
The asymmetry between the deﬁnitions of ﬂow and capacity of a cut is inten-
tional and important. For capacity, we count only the capacities of edges going
from S to T , ignoring edges in the reverse direction. For ﬂow, we consider the
ﬂow going from S to T minus the ﬂow going in the reverse direction from T to S.
The reason for this difference will become clear later in this section.

Corollary 26.5 yields the immediate consequence that the value of a maximum
ﬂow in a network is bounded from above by the capacity of a minimum cut of
the network. The important max-ﬂow min-cut theorem, which we now state and
prove, says that the value of a maximum ﬂow is in fact equal to the capacity of a
minimum cut.
Theorem 26.6 (Max-ﬂow min-cut theorem)
If f is a ﬂow in a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t, then the
following conditions are equivalent:
1. f is a maximum ﬂow in G.
2. The residual network Gf contains no augmenting paths.
3. jf j D c.S; T / for some cut .S; T / of G.
Proof
.1/ ) .2/: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that f is a maximum
ﬂow in G but that Gf has an augmenting path p. Then, by Corollary 26.3, the
ﬂow found by augmenting f by fp, where fp is given by equation (26.8), is a ﬂow
in G with value strictly greater than jf j, contradicting the assumption that f is a
maximum ﬂow.
.2/ ) .3/: Suppose that Gf has no augmenting path, that is, that Gf contains
no path from s to t. Deﬁne

and T D V  S. The partition .S; T / is a cut: we have s 2 S trivially and t 62 S
because there is no path from s to t in Gf .
Now consider a pair of vertices

The basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
In each iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson method, we ﬁnd some augmenting path p
and use p to modify the ﬂow f . As Lemma 26.2 and Corollary 26.3 suggest, we
replace f by f " fp, obtaining a new ﬂow whose value is jf j C jfpj. The follow-
ing implementation of the method computes the maximum ﬂow in a ﬂow network
G D .V; E/ by updating the ﬂow attribute .u; /:f for each edge .u; / 2 E.1
If .u; / 62 E, we assume implicitly that .u; /:f D 0. We also assume that we
are given the capacities c.u; / along with the ﬂow network, and c.u; / D 0
if .u; / 62 E. We compute the residual capacity cf .u; / in accordance with the
formula (26.2). The expression cf .p/ in the code is just a temporary variable that
stores the residual capacity of the path p.

26.2
The Ford-Fulkerson method
725
The FORD-FULKERSON algorithm simply expands on the FORD-FULKERSON-
METHOD pseudocode given earlier. Figure 26.6 shows the result of each iteration
in a sample run. Lines 1–2 initialize the ﬂow f to 0. The while loop of lines 3–8
repeatedly ﬁnds an augmenting path p in Gf and augments ﬂow f along p by
the residual capacity cf .p/. Each residual edge in path p is either an edge in the
original network or the reversal of an edge in the original network. Lines 6–8
update the ﬂow in each case appropriately, adding ﬂow when the residual edge is
an original edge and subtracting it otherwise. When no augmenting paths exist, the
ﬂow f is a maximum ﬂow.
Analysis of Ford-Fulkerson
The running time of FORD-FULKERSON depends on how we ﬁnd the augmenting
path p in line 3. If we choose it poorly, the algorithm might not even terminate: the
value of the ﬂow will increase with successive augmentations, but it need not even
converge to the maximum ﬂow value.2 If we ﬁnd the augmenting path by using a
breadth-ﬁrst search (which we saw in Section 22.2), however, the algorithm runs in
polynomial time. Before proving this result, we obtain a simple bound for the case
in which we choose the augmenting path arbitrarily and all capacities are integers.
In practice, the maximum-ﬂow problem often arises with integral capacities. If
the capacities are rational numbers, we can apply an appropriate scaling transfor-
mation to make them all integral. If f  denotes a maximum ﬂow in the transformed
network, then a straightforward implementation of FORD-FULKERSON executes
the while loop of lines 3–8 at most jf j times, since the ﬂow value increases by at
least one unit in each iteration.
We can perform the work done within the while loop efﬁciently if we implement
the ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with the right data structure and ﬁnd an augmenting
path by a linear-time algorithm. Let us assume that we keep a data structure cor-
responding to a directed graph G0 D .V; E0/, where E0 D f.u; / W .u; / 2 E or
.; u/ 2 Eg. Edges in the network G are also edges in G0, and therefore we can
easily maintain capacities and ﬂows in this data structure. Given a ﬂow f on G,
the edges in the residual network Gf consist of all edges .u; / of G0 such that
cf .u; / > 0, where cf conforms to equation (26.2). The time to ﬁnd a path in
a residual network is therefore O.V C E0/ D O.E/ if we use either depth-ﬁrst
search or breadth-ﬁrst search. Each iteration of the while loop thus takes O.E/
time, as does the initialization in lines 1–2, making the total running time of the
FORD-FULKERSON algorithm O.E jf j/.
2The Ford-Fulkerson method might fail to terminate only if edge capacities are irrational numbers.

The execution of the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. (a)–(e) Successive iterations of
the while loop. The left side of each part shows the residual network Gf from line 3 with a shaded
augmenting path p. The right side of each part shows the new ﬂow f that results from augmenting f
by fp. The residual network in (a) is the input network G.
When the capacities are integral and the optimal ﬂow value jf j is small, the
running time of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is good. Figure 26.7(a) shows an ex-
ample of what can happen on a simple ﬂow network for which jf j is large. A max-
imum ﬂow in this network has value 2,000,000: 1,000,000 units of ﬂow traverse
the path s ! u ! t, and another 1,000,000 units traverse the path s !  ! t. If
the ﬁrst augmenting path found by FORD-FULKERSON is s ! u !  ! t, shown
in Figure 26.7(a), the ﬂow has value 1 after the ﬁrst iteration. The resulting resid-
ual network appears in Figure 26.7(b). If the second iteration ﬁnds the augment-
ing path s !  ! u ! t, as shown in Figure 26.7(b), the ﬂow then has value 2.
Figure 26.7(c) shows the resulting residual network. We can continue, choosing
the augmenting path s ! u !  ! t in the odd-numbered iterations and the aug-
menting path s !  ! u ! t in the even-numbered iterations. We would perform
a total of 2,000,000 augmentations, increasing the ﬂow value by only 1 unit in each.

paths, and the ﬂow f shown in (e) is therefore a maximum ﬂow. The value of the maximum ﬂow
found is 23.
The Edmonds-Karp algorithm
We can improve the bound on FORD-FULKERSON by ﬁnding the augmenting
path p in line 3 with a breadth-ﬁrst search. That is, we choose the augmenting
path as a shortest path from s to t in the residual network, where each edge has
unit distance (weight). We call the Ford-Fulkerson method so implemented the
Edmonds-Karp algorithm. We now prove that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm runs
in O.VE2/ time.
The analysis depends on the distances to vertices in the residual network Gf .
The following lemma uses the notation ıf .u; / for the shortest-path distance
from u to  in Gf , where each edge has unit distance.
Lemma 26.7
If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with source s
and sink t, then for all vertices  2 V  fs; tg, the shortest-path distance ıf .s; /
in the residual network Gf increases monotonically with each ﬂow augmentation.

(a) A ﬂow network for which FORD-FULKERSON can take ‚.E jf j/ time,
where f  is a maximum ﬂow, shown here with jf j D 2,000,000. The shaded path is an aug-
menting path with residual capacity 1. (b) The resulting residual network, with another augmenting
path whose residual capacity is 1. (c) The resulting residual network.
Proof
We will suppose that for some vertex  2 V  fs; tg, there is a ﬂow aug-
mentation that causes the shortest-path distance from s to  to decrease, and then
we will derive a contradiction. Let f be the ﬂow just before the ﬁrst augmentation
that decreases some shortest-path distance, and let f 0 be the ﬂow just afterward.
Let  be the vertex with the minimum ıf 0.s; / whose distance was decreased by
the augmentation, so that ıf 0.s; / < ıf .s; /. Let p D s ; u !  be a shortest
path from s to  in Gf 0, so that .u; / 2 Ef 0 and
ıf 0.s; u/ D ıf 0.s; /  1 :
(26.12)
Because of how we chose , we know that the distance of vertex u from the source s
did not decrease, i.e.,
ıf 0.s; u/  ıf .s; u/ :
(26.13)
We claim that .u; / 62 Ef . Why? If we had .u; / 2 Ef , then we would also have
ıf .s; /


D
ıf 0.s; /
(by equation (26.12)) ,
which contradicts our assumption that ıf 0.s; / < ıf .s; /.
How can we have .u; / 62 Ef and .u; / 2 Ef 0? The augmentation must
have increased the ﬂow from  to u. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm always aug-
ments ﬂow along shortest paths, and therefore the shortest path from s to u in Gf
has .; u/ as its last edge. Therefore,

which contradicts our assumption that ıf 0.s; / < ıf .s; /. We conclude that our
assumption that such a vertex  exists is incorrect.
The next theorem bounds the number of iterations of the Edmonds-Karp algo-
rithm.
Theorem 26.8
If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with source s
and sink t, then the total number of ﬂow augmentations performed by the algorithm
is O.VE/.
Proof
We say that an edge .u; / in a residual network Gf is critical on an aug-
menting path p if the residual capacity of p is the residual capacity of .u; /, that
is, if cf .p/ D cf .u; /. After we have augmented ﬂow along an augmenting path,
any critical edge on the path disappears from the residual network. Moreover, at
least one edge on any augmenting path must be critical. We will show that each of
the jEj edges can become critical at most jV j =2 times.
Let u and  be vertices in V that are connected by an edge in E. Since augment-
ing paths are shortest paths, when .u; / is critical for the ﬁrst time, we have
ıf .s; / D ıf .s; u/ C 1 :
Once the ﬂow is augmented, the edge .u; / disappears from the residual network.
It cannot reappear later on another augmenting path until after the ﬂow from u to 
is decreased, which occurs only if .; u/ appears on an augmenting path. If f 0 is
the ﬂow in G when this event occurs, then we have
ıf 0.s; u/ D ıf 0.s; / C 1 :
Since ıf .s; /  ıf 0.s; / by Lemma 26.7, we have
ıf 0.s; u/
D
ıf 0.s; / C 1

ıf .s; / C 1
D
ıf .s; u/ C 2 :
Consequently, from the time .u; / becomes critical to the time when it next
becomes critical, the distance of u from the source increases by at least 2. The
distance of u from the source is initially at least 0. The intermediate vertices on a
shortest path from s to u cannot contain s, u, or t (since .u; / on an augmenting
path implies that u ¤ t). Therefore, until u becomes unreachable from the source,
if ever, its distance is at most jV j  2. Thus, after the ﬁrst time that .u; / becomes
critical, it can become critical at most .jV j  2/=2 D jV j =2  1 times more, for a
total of at most jV j =2 times. Since there are O.E/ pairs of vertices that can have an
edge between them in a residual network, the total number of critical edges during

the entire execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE/. Each augmenting
path has at least one critical edge, and hence the theorem follows.
Because we can implement each iteration of FORD-FULKERSON in O.E/ time
when we ﬁnd the augmenting path by breadth-ﬁrst search, the total running time of
the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE2/. We shall see that push-relabel algorithms
can yield even better bounds. The algorithm of Section 26.4 gives a method for
achieving an O.V 2E/ running time, which forms the basis for the O.V 3/-time

Maximum bipartite matching
Some combinatorial problems can easily be cast as maximum-ﬂow problems. The
multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-ﬂow problem from Section 26.1 gave us
one example. Some other combinatorial problems seem on the surface to have little
to do with ﬂow networks, but can in fact be reduced to maximum-ﬂow problems.
This section presents one such problem: ﬁnding a maximum matching in a bipartite
graph. In order to solve this problem, we shall take advantage of an integrality
property provided by the Ford-Fulkerson method. We shall also see how to use
the Ford-Fulkerson method to solve the maximum-bipartite-matching problem on
a graph G D .V; E/ in O.VE/ time.
The maximum-bipartite-matching problem
Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, a matching is a subset of edges M  E
such that for all vertices  2 V , at most one edge of M is incident on . We
say that a vertex  2 V is matched by the matching M if some edge in M is
incident on ; otherwise,  is unmatched. A maximum matching is a matching
of maximum cardinality, that is, a matching M such that for any matching M 0,
we have jMj  jM 0j. In this section, we shall restrict our attention to ﬁnding
maximum matchings in bipartite graphs: graphs in which the vertex set can be
partitioned into V D L [ R, where L and R are disjoint and all edges in E
go between L and R. We further assume that every vertex in V has at least one
incident edge. Figure 26.8 illustrates the notion of a matching in a bipartite graph.
The problem of ﬁnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph has many
practical applications. As an example, we might consider matching a set L of ma-
chines with a set R of tasks to be performed simultaneously. We take the presence
of edge .u; / in E to mean that a particular machine u 2 L is capable of per-
forming a particular task  2 R. A maximum matching provides work for as many
machines as possible.
Finding a maximum bipartite matching
We can use the Ford-Fulkerson method to ﬁnd a maximum matching in an undi-
rected bipartite graph G D .V; E/ in time polynomial in jV j and jEj. The trick is
to construct a ﬂow network in which ﬂows correspond to matchings, as shown in
Figure 26.8(c). We deﬁne the corresponding ﬂow network G0 D .V 0; E0/ for the
bipartite graph G as follows. We let the source s and sink t be new vertices not
in V , and we let V 0 D V [ fs; tg. If the vertex partition of G is V D L [ R, the

corresponding ﬂow network G0 with a maximum ﬂow shown. Each edge has unit capacity. Shaded
edges have a ﬂow of 1, and all other edges carry no ﬂow. The shaded edges from L to R correspond
to those in the maximum matching from (b).
directed edges of G0 are the edges of E, directed from L to R, along with jV j new
directed edges:
E0 D f.s; u/ W u 2 Lg [ f.u; / W .u; / 2 Eg [ f.; t/ W  2 Rg :
To complete the construction, we assign unit capacity to each edge in E0. Since
each vertex in V has at least one incident edge, jEj  jV j =2. Thus, jEj  jE0j D
jEj C jV j  3 jEj, and so jE0j D ‚.E/.
The following lemma shows that a matching in G corresponds directly to a ﬂow
in G’s corresponding ﬂow network G0. We say that a ﬂow f on a ﬂow network
G D .V; E/ is integer-valued if f .u; / is an integer for all .u; / 2 V 	 V .
Lemma 26.9
Let G D .V; E/ be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V D L [ R, and let
G0 D .V 0; E0/ be its corresponding ﬂow network. If M is a matching in G, then
there is an integer-valued ﬂow f in G0 with value jf j D jMj. Conversely, if f
is an integer-valued ﬂow in G0, then there is a matching M in G with cardinality
jMj D jf j.
Proof
We ﬁrst show that a matching M in G corresponds to an integer-valued
ﬂow f in G0. Deﬁne f as follows. If .u; / 2 M, then f .s; u/ D f .u; / D
f .; t/ D 1. For all other edges .u; / 2 E0, we deﬁne f .u; / D 0. It is simple
to verify that f satisﬁes the capacity constraint and ﬂow conservation.

734
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
Intuitively, each edge .u; / 2 M corresponds to one unit of ﬂow in G0 that
traverses the path s ! u !  ! t. Moreover, the paths induced by edges in M
are vertex-disjoint, except for s and t. The net ﬂow across cut .L [ fsg ; R [ ftg/
is equal to jMj; thus, by Lemma 26.4, the value of the ﬂow is jf j D jMj.
To prove the converse, let f be an integer-valued ﬂow in G0, and let
M D f.u; / W u 2 L;  2 R; and f .u; / > 0g :
Each vertex u 2 L has only one entering edge, namely .s; u/, and its capacity
is 1. Thus, each u 2 L has at most one unit of ﬂow entering it, and if one unit of
ﬂow does enter, by ﬂow conservation, one unit of ﬂow must leave. Furthermore,
since f is integer-valued, for each u 2 L, the one unit of ﬂow can enter on at most
one edge and can leave on at most one edge. Thus, one unit of ﬂow enters u if and
only if there is exactly one vertex  2 R such that f .u; / D 1, and at most one
edge leaving each u 2 L carries positive ﬂow. A symmetric argument applies to
each  2 R. The set M is therefore a matching.
To see that jMj D jf j, observe that for every matched vertex u 2 L, we have
f .s; u/ D 1, and for every edge .u; / 2 E  M, we have f .u; / D 0. Conse-
quently, f .L [ fsg ; R [ ftg/, the net ﬂow across cut .L [ fsg ; R [ ftg/, is equal
to jMj. Applying Lemma 26.4, we have that jf j D f .L[fsg ; R[ftg/ D jMj.
Based on Lemma 26.9, we would like to conclude that a maximum matching
in a bipartite graph G corresponds to a maximum ﬂow in its corresponding ﬂow
network G0, and we can therefore compute a maximum matching in G by running
a maximum-ﬂow algorithm on G0. The only hitch in this reasoning is that the
maximum-ﬂow algorithm might return a ﬂow in G0 for which some f .u; / is
not an integer, even though the ﬂow value jf j must be an integer. The following
theorem shows that if we use the Ford-Fulkerson method, this difﬁculty cannot
arise.
Theorem 26.10 (Integrality theorem)
If the capacity function c takes on only integral values, then the maximum ﬂow f
produced by the Ford-Fulkerson method has the property that jf j is an integer.
Moreover, for all vertices u and , the value of f .u; / is an integer.
Proof
The proof is by induction on the number of iterations. We leave it as
Exercise 26.3-2.
We can now prove the following corollary to Lemma 26.9.

26.3
Maximum bipartite matching
735
Corollary 26.11
The cardinality of a maximum matching M in a bipartite graph G equals the value
of a maximum ﬂow f in its corresponding ﬂow network G0.
Proof
We use the nomenclature from Lemma 26.9. Suppose that M is a max-
imum matching in G and that the corresponding ﬂow f in G0 is not maximum.
Then there is a maximum ﬂow f 0 in G0 such that jf 0j > jf j. Since the ca-
pacities in G0 are integer-valued, by Theorem 26.10, we can assume that f 0 is
integer-valued.
Thus, f 0 corresponds to a matching M 0 in G with cardinality
jM 0j D jf 0j > jf j D jMj, contradicting our assumption that M is a maximum
matching. In a similar manner, we can show that if f is a maximum ﬂow in G0, its
corresponding matching is a maximum matching on G.
Thus, given a bipartite undirected graph G, we can ﬁnd a maximum matching by
creating the ﬂow network G0, running the Ford-Fulkerson method, and directly ob-
taining a maximum matching M from the integer-valued maximum ﬂow f found.
Since any matching in a bipartite graph has cardinality at most min.L; R/ D O.V /,
the value of the maximum ﬂow in G0 is O.V /. We can therefore ﬁnd a maximum
matching in a bipartite graph in time O.VE0/ D O.VE/, since jE0j D ‚.E/.

Push-relabel algorithms
In this section, we present the “push-relabel” approach to computing maximum
ﬂows. To date, many of the asymptotically fastest maximum-ﬂow algorithms are
push-relabel algorithms, and the fastest actual implementations of maximum-ﬂow
algorithms are based on the push-relabel method. Push-relabel methods also efﬁ-
ciently solve other ﬂow problems, such as the minimum-cost ﬂow problem. This
section introduces Goldberg’s “generic” maximum-ﬂow algorithm, which has a
simple implementation that runs in O.V 2E/ time, thereby improving upon the
O.VE2/ bound of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. Section 26.5 reﬁnes the generic
algorithm to obtain another push-relabel algorithm that runs in O.V 3/ time.
Push-relabel algorithms work in a more localized manner than the Ford-
Fulkerson method. Rather than examine the entire residual network to ﬁnd an aug-
menting path, push-relabel algorithms work on one vertex at a time, looking only
at the vertex’s neighbors in the residual network. Furthermore, unlike the Ford-
Fulkerson method, push-relabel algorithms do not maintain the ﬂow-conservation
property throughout their execution. They do, however, maintain a preﬂow, which
is a function f W V 	V ! R that satisﬁes the capacity constraint and the following
relaxation of ﬂow conservation:
X

f .; u/ 
X

for all vertices u 2 V  fsg. That is, the ﬂow into a vertex may exceed the ﬂow
out. We call the quantity

X
2V
f .; u/ 
X
2V
f .u; /
(26.14)
the excess ﬂow into vertex u. The excess at a vertex is the amount by which the
ﬂow in exceeds the ﬂow out. We say that a vertex u 2 V  fs; tg is overﬂowing if
e.u/ > 0.

26.4
Push-relabel algorithms
737
We shall begin this section by describing the intuition behind the push-relabel
method. We shall then investigate the two operations employed by the method:
“pushing” preﬂow and “relabeling” a vertex. Finally, we shall present a generic
push-relabel algorithm and analyze its correctness and running time.
Intuition
You can understand the intuition behind the push-relabel method in terms of ﬂuid
ﬂows: we consider a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ to be a system of interconnected
pipes of given capacities. Applying this analogy to the Ford-Fulkerson method,
we might say that each augmenting path in the network gives rise to an additional
stream of ﬂuid, with no branch points, ﬂowing from the source to the sink. The
Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively adds more streams of ﬂow until no more can be
added.
The generic push-relabel algorithm has a rather different intuition. As before,
directed edges correspond to pipes. Vertices, which are pipe junctions, have two
interesting properties. First, to accommodate excess ﬂow, each vertex has an out-
ﬂow pipe leading to an arbitrarily large reservoir that can accumulate ﬂuid. Second,
each vertex, its reservoir, and all its pipe connections sit on a platform whose height
increases as the algorithm progresses.
Vertex heights determine how ﬂow is pushed: we push ﬂow only downhill, that
is, from a higher vertex to a lower vertex. The ﬂow from a lower vertex to a higher
vertex may be positive, but operations that push ﬂow push it only downhill. We
ﬁx the height of the source at jV j and the height of the sink at 0. All other vertex
heights start at 0 and increase with time. The algorithm ﬁrst sends as much ﬂow as
possible downhill from the source toward the sink. The amount it sends is exactly
enough to ﬁll each outgoing pipe from the source to capacity; that is, it sends the
capacity of the cut .s; V  fsg/. When ﬂow ﬁrst enters an intermediate vertex, it
collects in the vertex’s reservoir. From there, we eventually push it downhill.
We may eventually ﬁnd that the only pipes that leave a vertex u and are not
already saturated with ﬂow connect to vertices that are on the same level as u or
are uphill from u. In this case, to rid an overﬂowing vertex u of its excess ﬂow, we
must increase its height—an operation called “relabeling” vertex u. We increase
its height to one unit more than the height of the lowest of its neighbors to which
it has an unsaturated pipe. After a vertex is relabeled, therefore, it has at least one
outgoing pipe through which we can push more ﬂow.
Eventually, all the ﬂow that can possibly get through to the sink has arrived there.
No more can arrive, because the pipes obey the capacity constraints; the amount of
ﬂow across any cut is still limited by the capacity of the cut. To make the preﬂow
a “legal” ﬂow, the algorithm then sends the excess collected in the reservoirs of

the ﬁxed height jV j of the source. As we shall see, once we have emptied all the
reservoirs, the preﬂow is not only a “legal” ﬂow, it is also a maximum ﬂow.
The basic operations
From the preceding discussion, we see that a push-relabel algorithm performs two
basic operations: pushing ﬂow excess from a vertex to one of its neighbors and
relabeling a vertex. The situations in which these operations apply depend on the
heights of vertices, which we now deﬁne precisely.
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, and let f be a
preﬂow in G. A function h W V ! N is a height function3 if h.s/ D jV j,
h.t/ D 0, and
h.u/  h./ C 1
for every residual edge .u; / 2 Ef . We immediately obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 26.12
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network, let f be a preﬂow in G, and let h be a height
function on V . For any two vertices u;  2 V , if h.u/ > h./ C 1, then .u; / is
not an edge in the residual network.
The push operation
The basic operation PUSH.u; / applies if u is an overﬂowing vertex, cf .u; / > 0,
and h.u/ D h./C1. The pseudocode below updates the preﬂow f and the excess
ﬂows for u and . It assumes that we can compute residual capacity cf .u; / in
constant time given c and f . We maintain the excess ﬂow stored at a vertex u as
the attribute u:e and the height of u as the attribute u:h. The expression 
f .u; /
is a temporary variable that stores the amount of ﬂow that we can push from u to .
3In the literature, a height function is typically called a “distance function,” and the height of a vertex
is called a “distance label.” We use the term “height” because it is more suggestive of the intuition
behind the algorithm. We retain the use of the term “relabel” to refer to the operation that increases
the height of a vertex. The height of a vertex is related to its distance from the sink t, as would be
found in a breadth-ﬁrst search of the transpose GT.

The code for PUSH operates as follows. Because vertex u has a positive excess u:e
and the residual capacity of .u; / is positive, we can increase the ﬂow from u to 
by 
f .u; / D min.u:e; cf .u; // without causing u:e to become negative or the
capacity c.u; / to be exceeded. Line 3 computes the value 
f .u; /, and lines 4–6
update f . Line 5 increases the ﬂow on edge .u; /, because we are pushing ﬂow
over a residual edge that is also an original edge. Line 6 decreases the ﬂow on
edge .; u/, because the residual edge is actually the reverse of an edge in the
original network. Finally, lines 7–8 update the excess ﬂows into vertices u and .
Thus, if f is a preﬂow before PUSH is called, it remains a preﬂow afterward.
Observe that nothing in the code for PUSH depends on the heights of u and ,
yet we prohibit it from being invoked unless u:h D :h C 1. Thus, we push excess
ﬂow downhill only by a height differential of 1. By Lemma 26.12, no residual
edges exist between two vertices whose heights differ by more than 1, and thus,
as long as the attribute h is indeed a height function, we would gain nothing by
allowing ﬂow to be pushed downhill by a height differential of more than 1.
We call the operation PUSH.u; / a push from u to . If a push operation ap-
plies to some edge .u; / leaving a vertex u, we also say that the push operation
applies to u. It is a saturating push if edge .u; / in the residual network becomes
saturated (cf .u; / D 0 afterward); otherwise, it is a nonsaturating push. If an
edge becomes saturated, it disappears from the residual network. A simple lemma
characterizes one result of a nonsaturating push.
Lemma 26.13
After a nonsaturating push from u to , the vertex u is no longer overﬂowing.
Proof
Since the push was nonsaturating, the amount of ﬂow 
f .u; / actually
pushed must equal u:e prior to the push. Since u:e is reduced by this amount, it
becomes 0 after the push.

The relabel operation
The basic operation RELABEL.u/ applies if u is overﬂowing and if u:h  :h for
all edges .u; / 2 Ef . In other words, we can relabel an overﬂowing vertex u if
for every vertex  for which there is residual capacity from u to , ﬂow cannot be
pushed from u to  because  is not downhill from u. (Recall that by deﬁnition,
neither the source s nor the sink t can be overﬂowing, and so s and t are ineligible
for relabeling.)
RELABEL.u/

// Applies when: u is overﬂowing and for all  2 V such that .u; / 2 Ef ,
we have u:h  :h.
2
// Action: Increase the height of u.
3
u:h D 1 C min f:h W .u; / 2 Ef g
When we call the operation RELABEL.u/, we say that vertex u is relabeled. Note
that when u is relabeled, Ef must contain at least one edge that leaves u, so that
the minimization in the code is over a nonempty set. This property follows from
the assumption that u is overﬂowing, which in turn tells us that
u:e D
X
2V
f .; u/ 
X

f .u; / > 0 :
Since all ﬂows are nonnegative, we must therefore have at least one vertex  such
that .; u/:f > 0. But then, cf .u; / > 0, which implies that .u; / 2 Ef . The
operation RELABEL.u/ thus gives u the greatest height allowed by the constraints
on height functions.
The generic algorithm

tial preﬂow in the ﬂow network.

That is, we ﬁll to capacity each edge leaving the source s, and all other edges carry

and we initialize s:e to the negative of the sum of these capacities. The generic
algorithm also begins with an initial height function h, given by

means that they are not in the residual network.

The following lemma tells us that as long as an overﬂowing vertex exists, at least
one of the two basic operations applies.
Lemma 26.14 (An overﬂowing vertex can be either pushed or relabeled)
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, let f be a preﬂow,
and let h be any height function for f . If u is any overﬂowing vertex, then either a
push or relabel operation applies to it.
Proof
For any residual edge .u; /, we have h.u/  h./ C 1 because h is a
height function. If a push operation does not apply to an overﬂowing vertex u,
then for all residual edges .u; /, we must have h.u/ < h./ C 1, which implies
h.u/  h./. Thus, a relabel operation applies to u.
Correctness of the push-relabel method
To show that the generic push-relabel algorithm solves the maximum-ﬂow prob-
lem, we shall ﬁrst prove that if it terminates, the preﬂow f is a maximum ﬂow.
We shall later prove that it terminates. We start with some observations about the
height function h.

Lemma 26.15 (Vertex heights never decrease)
During the execution of the GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL procedure on a ﬂow net-
work G D .V; E/, for each vertex u 2 V , the height u:h never decreases. More-
over, whenever a relabel operation is applied to a vertex u, its height u:h increases
by at least 1.
Proof
Because vertex heights change only during relabel operations, it sufﬁces
to prove the second statement of the lemma.
If vertex u is about to be rela-
beled, then for all vertices  such that .u; / 2 Ef , we have u:h  :h. Thus,
u:h < 1 C min f:h W .u; / 2 Ef g, and so the operation must increase u:h.
Lemma 26.16
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t. Then the execution of
GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on G maintains the attribute h as a height function.
Proof
The proof is by induction on the number of basic operations performed.
Initially, h is a height function, as we have already observed.
We claim that if h is a height function, then an operation RELABEL.u/ leaves h
a height function. If we look at a residual edge .u; / 2 Ef that leaves u, then
the operation RELABEL.u/ ensures that u:h  :h C 1 afterward. Now consider
a residual edge .w; u/ that enters u. By Lemma 26.15, w:h  u:h C 1 before the
operation RELABEL.u/ implies w:h < u:h C 1 afterward. Thus, the operation
RELABEL.u/ leaves h a height function.
Now, consider an operation PUSH.u; /. This operation may add the edge .; u/
to Ef , and it may remove .u; / from Ef .
In the former case, we have
:h D u:h  1 < u:h C 1, and so h remains a height function. In the latter case,
removing .u; / from the residual network removes the corresponding constraint,
and h again remains a height function.
The following lemma gives an important property of height functions.
Lemma 26.17
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, let f be a preﬂow
in G, and let h be a height function on V . Then there is no path from the source s
to the sink t in the residual network Gf .
Proof
Assume for the sake of contradiction that Gf contains a path p from s to t,
where p D h0; 1; : : : ; ki, 0 D s, and k D t. Without loss of generality, p
is a simple path, and so k < jV j. For i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1, edge .i; iC1/ 2 Ef .
Because h is a height function, h.i/  h.iC1/ C 1 for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1. Com-
bining these inequalities over path p yields h.s/  h.t/Ck. But because h.t/ D 0,

26.4
Push-relabel algorithms
743
we have h.s/  k < jV j, which contradicts the requirement that h.s/ D jV j in a
height function.
We are now ready to show that if the generic push-relabel algorithm terminates,
the preﬂow it computes is a maximum ﬂow.
Theorem 26.18 (Correctness of the generic push-relabel algorithm)
If the algorithm GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL terminates when run on a ﬂow net-
work G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t, then the preﬂow f it computes is a
maximum ﬂow for G.
Proof
We use the following loop invariant:
Each time the while loop test in line 2 in GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL is
executed, f is a preﬂow.
Initialization: INITIALIZE-PREFLOW makes f a preﬂow.
Maintenance: The only operations within the while loop of lines 2–3 are push and
relabel. Relabel operations affect only height attributes and not the ﬂow values;
hence they do not affect whether f is a preﬂow. As argued on page 739, if f is
a preﬂow prior to a push operation, it remains a preﬂow afterward.
Termination: At termination, each vertex in V  fs; tg must have an excess of 0,
because by Lemma 26.14 and the invariant that f is always a preﬂow, there are
no overﬂowing vertices. Therefore, f is a ﬂow. Lemma 26.16 shows that h is
a height function at termination, and thus Lemma 26.17 tells us that there is no
path from s to t in the residual network Gf . By the max-ﬂow min-cut theorem
(Theorem 26.6), therefore, f is a maximum ﬂow.
Analysis of the push-relabel method
To show that the generic push-relabel algorithm indeed terminates, we shall bound
the number of operations it performs. We bound separately each of the three types
of operations: relabels, saturating pushes, and nonsaturating pushes. With knowl-
edge of these bounds, it is a straightforward problem to construct an algorithm that
runs in O.V 2E/ time. Before beginning the analysis, however, we prove an im-
portant lemma. Recall that we allow edges into the source in the residual network.
Lemma 26.19
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, and let f be a preﬂow
in G. Then, for any overﬂowing vertex x, there is a simple path from x to s in the
residual network Gf .

u0 2 U and 0 2 U with f .0; u0/ > 0. But, if f .0; u0/ > 0, there must be a
residual edge .u0; 0/, which means that there is a simple path from x to 0 (the
path x ; u0 ! 0), thus contradicting the deﬁnition of U .
The next lemma bounds the heights of vertices, and its corollary bounds the
number of relabel operations that are performed in total.
Lemma 26.20
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t. At any time during
the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on G, we have u:h  2 jV j1 for all
vertices u 2 V .
Proof
The heights of the source s and the sink t never change because these
vertices are by deﬁnition not overﬂowing. Thus, we always have s:h D jV j and
t:h D 0, both of which are no greater than 2 jV j  1.
Now consider any vertex u 2 V fs; tg. Initially, u:h D 0  2 jV j1. We shall
show that after each relabeling operation, we still have u:h  2 jV j  1. When u is

26.4
Push-relabel algorithms
745
relabeled, it is overﬂowing, and Lemma 26.19 tells us that there is a simple path p
from u to s in Gf . Let p D h0;1;: : : ;ki, where 0 D u, k D s, and k  jV j1
because p is simple. For i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1, we have .i; iC1/ 2 Ef , and
therefore, by Lemma 26.16, i:h  iC1:h C 1. Expanding these inequalities over
path p yields u:h D 0:h  k:h C k  s:h C .jV j  1/ D 2 jV j  1.
Corollary 26.21 (Bound on relabel operations)
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t. Then, during the
execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on G, the number of relabel operations is
at most 2 jV j  1 per vertex and at most .2 jV j  1/.jV j  2/ < 2 jV j2 overall.
Proof
Only the jV j2 vertices in V fs; tg may be relabeled. Let u 2 V fs; tg.
The operation RELABEL.u/ increases u:h. The value of u:h is initially 0 and by
Lemma 26.20, it grows to at most 2 jV j  1. Thus, each vertex u 2 V  fs; tg
is relabeled at most 2 jV j  1 times, and the total number of relabel operations
performed is at most .2 jV j  1/.jV j  2/ < 2 jV j2.
Lemma 26.20 also helps us to bound the number of saturating pushes.
Lemma 26.22 (Bound on saturating pushes)
During the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on any ﬂow network G D
.V; E/, the number of saturating pushes is less than 2 jV j jEj.
Proof
For any pair of vertices u;  2 V , we will count the saturating pushes
from u to  and from  to u together, calling them the saturating pushes between u
and . If there are any such pushes, at least one of .u; / and .; u/ is actually
an edge in E. Now, suppose that a saturating push from u to  has occurred.
At that time, :h D u:h  1. In order for another push from u to  to occur
later, the algorithm must ﬁrst push ﬂow from  to u, which cannot happen until
:h D u:h C 1. Since u:h never decreases, in order for :h D u:h C 1, the
value of :h must increase by at least 2. Likewise, u:h must increase by at least 2
between saturating pushes from  to u. Heights start at 0 and, by Lemma 26.20,
never exceed 2 jV j1, which implies that the number of times any vertex can have
its height increase by 2 is less than jV j. Since at least one of u:h and :h must
increase by 2 between any two saturating pushes between u and , there are fewer
than 2 jV j saturating pushes between u and . Multiplying by the number of edges
gives a bound of less than 2 jV j jEj on the total number of saturating pushes.
The following lemma bounds the number of nonsaturating pushes in the generic
push-relabel algorithm.

746
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
Lemma 26.23 (Bound on nonsaturating pushes)
During the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on any ﬂow network G D
.V; E/, the number of nonsaturating pushes is less than 4 jV j2 .jV j C jEj/.
Proof
Deﬁne a potential function ˆ D P
We./>0 :h. Initially, ˆ D 0, and the
value of ˆ may change after each relabeling, saturating push, and nonsaturating
push. We will bound the amount that saturating pushes and relabelings can con-
tribute to the increase of ˆ. Then we will show that each nonsaturating push must
decrease ˆ by at least 1, and will use these bounds to derive an upper bound on the
number of nonsaturating pushes.
Let us examine the two ways in which ˆ might increase. First, relabeling a
vertex u increases ˆ by less than 2 jV j, since the set over which the sum is taken is
the same and the relabeling cannot increase u’s height by more than its maximum
possible height, which, by Lemma 26.20, is at most 2 jV j  1. Second, a saturating
push from a vertex u to a vertex  increases ˆ by less than 2 jV j, since no heights
change and only vertex , whose height is at most 2 jV j  1, can possibly become
overﬂowing.
Now we show that a nonsaturating push from u to  decreases ˆ by at least 1.
Why? Before the nonsaturating push, u was overﬂowing, and  may or may not
have been overﬂowing. By Lemma 26.13, u is no longer overﬂowing after the
push. In addition, unless  is the source, it may or may not be overﬂowing after
the push. Therefore, the potential function ˆ has decreased by exactly u:h, and it
has increased by either 0 or :h. Since u:h  :h D 1, the net effect is that the
potential function has decreased by at least 1.
Thus, during the course of the algorithm, the total amount of increase in ˆ is
due to relabelings and saturated pushes, and Corollary 26.21 and Lemma 26.22
constrain the increase to be less than .2 jV j/.2 jV j2/ C .2 jV j/.2 jV j jEj/ D
4 jV j2 .jV j C jEj/. Since ˆ  0, the total amount of decrease, and therefore the
total number of nonsaturating pushes, is less than 4 jV j2 .jV j C jEj/.
Having bounded the number of relabelings, saturating pushes, and nonsatu-
rating push, we have set the stage for the following analysis of the GENERIC-
PUSH-RELABEL procedure, and hence of any algorithm based on the push-relabel
method.
Theorem 26.24
During the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on any ﬂow network G D

Thus, the algorithm terminates after O.V 2E/ operations. All that remains is
to give an efﬁcient method for implementing each operation and for choosing an
appropriate operation to execute.
Corollary 26.25
There is an implementation of the generic push-relabel algorithm that runs in

Exercise 26.4-2 asks you to show how to implement the generic algorithm
with an overhead of O.V / per relabel operation and O.1/ per push. It also asks
you to design a data structure that allows you to pick an applicable operation in

The relabel-to-front algorithm
The push-relabel method allows us to apply the basic operations in any order at
all. By choosing the order carefully and managing the network data structure efﬁ-
ciently, however, we can solve the maximum-ﬂow problem faster than the O.V 2E/
bound given by Corollary 26.25. We shall now examine the relabel-to-front algo-
rithm, a push-relabel algorithm whose running time is O.V 3/, which is asymptot-
ically at least as good as O.V 2E/, and even better for dense networks.
The relabel-to-front algorithm maintains a list of the vertices in the network.
Beginning at the front, the algorithm scans the list, repeatedly selecting an over-
ﬂowing vertex u and then “discharging” it, that is, performing push and relabel
operations until u no longer has a positive excess. Whenever we relabel a ver-
tex, we move it to the front of the list (hence the name “relabel-to-front”) and the
algorithm begins its scan anew.

26.5
The relabel-to-front algorithm
749
The correctness and analysis of the relabel-to-front algorithm depend on the
notion of “admissible” edges: those edges in the residual network through which
ﬂow can be pushed. After proving some properties about the network of admissible
edges, we shall investigate the discharge operation and then present and analyze the
relabel-to-front algorithm itself.
Admissible edges and networks
If G D .V; E/ is a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, f is a preﬂow in G, and h
is a height function, then we say that .u; / is an admissible edge if cf .u; / > 0
and h.u/ D h./ C 1. Otherwise, .u; / is inadmissible. The admissible network
is Gf;h D .V; Ef;h/, where Ef;h is the set of admissible edges.
The admissible network consists of those edges through which we can push ﬂow.
The following lemma shows that this network is a directed acyclic graph (dag).
Lemma 26.26 (The admissible network is acyclic)
If G D .V; E/ is a ﬂow network, f is a preﬂow in G, and h is a height function
on G, then the admissible network Gf;h D .V; Ef;h/ is acyclic.
Proof
The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that Gf;h contains a cycle p D
h0;1;: : : ;ki, where 0 D k and k > 0. Since each edge in p is admissible, we
have h.i1/ D h.i/ C 1 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Summing around the cycle gives

h.i1/
D

X
iD1
.h.i/ C 1/
D
k
X
iD1
h.i/ C k :
Because each vertex in cycle p appears once in each of the summations, we derive
the contradiction that 0 D k.
The next two lemmas show how push and relabel operations change the admis-
sible network.
Lemma 26.27
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network, let f be a preﬂow in G, and suppose that the
attribute h is a height function. If a vertex u is overﬂowing and .u; / is an ad-
missible edge, then PUSH.u; / applies. The operation does not create any new
admissible edges, but it may cause .u; / to become inadmissible.

750
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
Proof
By the deﬁnition of an admissible edge, we can push ﬂow from u to .
Since u is overﬂowing, the operation PUSH.u; / applies. The only new residual
edge that pushing ﬂow from u to  can create is .; u/. Since :h D u:h  1,
edge .; u/ cannot become admissible. If the operation is a saturating push, then
cf .u; / D 0 afterward and .u; / becomes inadmissible.
Lemma 26.28
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network, let f be a preﬂow in G, and suppose that
the attribute h is a height function. If a vertex u is overﬂowing and there are no
admissible edges leaving u, then RELABEL.u/ applies. After the relabel operation,
there is at least one admissible edge leaving u, but there are no admissible edges
entering u.
Proof
If u is overﬂowing, then by Lemma 26.14, either a push or a relabel op-
eration applies to it. If there are no admissible edges leaving u, then no ﬂow
can be pushed from u and so RELABEL.u/ applies. After the relabel operation,
u:h D 1 C min f:h W .u; / 2 Ef g. Thus, if  is a vertex that realizes the mini-
mum in this set, the edge .u; / becomes admissible. Hence, after the relabel, there
is at least one admissible edge leaving u.
To show that no admissible edges enter u after a relabel operation, suppose that
there is a vertex  such that .; u/ is admissible. Then, :h D u:h C 1 after the
relabel, and so :h > u:h C 1 just before the relabel. But by Lemma 26.12, no
residual edges exist between vertices whose heights differ by more than 1. More-
over, relabeling a vertex does not change the residual network. Thus, .; u/ is not
in the residual network, and hence it cannot be in the admissible network.
Neighbor lists
Edges in the relabel-to-front algorithm are organized into “neighbor lists.” Given
a ﬂow network G D .V; E/, the neighbor list u:N for a vertex u 2 V is a singly
linked list of the neighbors of u in G. Thus, vertex  appears in the list u:N if
.u; / 2 E or .; u/ 2 E. The neighbor list u:N contains exactly those vertices 
for which there may be a residual edge .u; /. The attribute u:N:head points to
the ﬁrst vertex in u:N, and :next-neighbor points to the vertex following  in a
neighbor list; this pointer is NIL if  is the last vertex in the neighbor list.
The relabel-to-front algorithm cycles through each neighbor list in an arbitrary
order that is ﬁxed throughout the execution of the algorithm. For each vertex u,
the attribute u:current points to the vertex currently under consideration in u:N.
Initially, u:current is set to u:N:head.

26.5
The relabel-to-front algorithm
751
Discharging an overﬂowing vertex
An overﬂowing vertex u is discharged by pushing all of its excess ﬂow through
admissible edges to neighboring vertices, relabeling u as necessary to cause edges
leaving u to become admissible. The pseudocode goes as follows.
DISCHARGE.u/
1
while u:e > 0
2
 D u:current
3
if  == NIL
4
RELABEL.u/
5
u:current D u:N:head
6
elseif cf .u; / > 0 and u:h == :h C 1
7
PUSH.u; /
8
else u:current D :next-neighbor
Figure 26.9 steps through several iterations of the while loop of lines 1–8, which
executes as long as vertex u has positive excess. Each iteration performs exactly
one of three actions, depending on the current vertex  in the neighbor list u:N.
1. If  is NIL, then we have run off the end of u:N. Line 4 relabels vertex u,
and then line 5 resets the current neighbor of u to be the ﬁrst one in u:N.
(Lemma 26.29 below states that the relabel operation applies in this situation.)
2. If  is non-NIL and .u; / is an admissible edge (determined by the test in
line 6), then line 7 pushes some (or possibly all) of u’s excess to vertex .
3. If  is non-NIL but .u; / is inadmissible, then line 8 advances u:current one
position further in the neighbor list u:N.
Observe that if DISCHARGE is called on an overﬂowing vertex u, then the last
action performed by DISCHARGE must be a push from u. Why? The procedure
terminates only when u:e becomes zero, and neither the relabel operation nor ad-
vancing the pointer u:current affects the value of u:e.
We must be sure that when PUSH or RELABEL is called by DISCHARGE, the
operation applies. The next lemma proves this fact.
Lemma 26.29
If DISCHARGE calls PUSH.u; / in line 7, then a push operation applies to .u; /.
If DISCHARGE calls RELABEL.u/ in line 4, then a relabel operation applies to u.
Proof
The tests in lines 1 and 6 ensure that a push operation occurs only if the
operation applies, which proves the ﬁrst statement in the lemma.

Discharging a vertex y. It takes 15 iterations of the while loop of DISCHARGE to push
all the excess ﬂow from y. Only the neighbors of y and edges of the ﬂow network that enter or leave y
are shown. In each part of the ﬁgure, the number inside each vertex is its excess at the beginning of
the ﬁrst iteration shown in the part, and each vertex is shown at its height throughout the part. The
neighbor list y:N at the beginning of each iteration appears on the right, with the iteration number
on top. The shaded neighbor is y:current. (a) Initially, there are 19 units of excess to push from y,
and y:current D s. Iterations 1, 2, and 3 just advance y:current, since there are no admissible edges
leaving y. In iteration 4, y:current D NIL (shown by the shading being below the neighbor list),
and so y is relabeled and y:current is reset to the head of the neighbor list. (b) After relabeling,
vertex y has height 1. In iterations 5 and 6, edges .y; s/ and .y; x/ are found to be inadmissible, but
iteration 7 pushes 8 units of excess ﬂow from y to ´. Because of the push, y:current does not advance
in this iteration. (c) Because the push in iteration 7 saturated edge .y; ´/, it is found inadmissible in
iteration 8. In iteration 9, y:current D NIL, and so vertex y is again relabeled and y:current is reset.

(d) In iteration 10, .y; s/ is inadmissible, but iteration 11 pushes 5 units
of excess ﬂow from y to x. (e) Because y:current did not advance in iteration 11, iteration 12
ﬁnds .y; x/ to be inadmissible. Iteration 13 ﬁnds .y;´/ inadmissible, and iteration 14 relabels ver-
tex y and resets y:current. (f) Iteration 15 pushes 6 units of excess ﬂow from y to s. (g) Vertex y
now has no excess ﬂow, and DISCHARGE terminates. In this example, DISCHARGE both starts and
ﬁnishes with the current pointer at the head of the neighbor list, but in general this need not be the
case.

754
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
To prove the second statement, according to the test in line 1 and Lemma 26.28,
we need only show that all edges leaving u are inadmissible.
If a call to
DISCHARGE.u/ starts with the pointer u:current at the head of u’s neighbor list
and ﬁnishes with it off the end of the list, then all of u’s outgoing edges are in-
admissible and a relabel operation applies. It is possible, however, that during a
call to DISCHARGE.u/, the pointer u:current traverses only part of the list be-
fore the procedure returns. Calls to DISCHARGE on other vertices may then oc-
cur, but u:current will continue moving through the list during the next call to
DISCHARGE.u/. We now consider what happens during a complete pass through
the list, which begins at the head of u:N and ﬁnishes with u:current D NIL. Once
u:current reaches the end of the list, the procedure relabels u and begins a new
pass. For the u:current pointer to advance past a vertex  2 u:N during a pass, the
edge .u; / must be deemed inadmissible by the test in line 6. Thus, by the time
the pass completes, every edge leaving u has been determined to be inadmissible
at some time during the pass. The key observation is that at the end of the pass,
every edge leaving u is still inadmissible. Why? By Lemma 26.27, pushes cannot
create any admissible edges, regardless of which vertex the ﬂow is pushed from.
Thus, any admissible edge must be created by a relabel operation. But the vertex u
is not relabeled during the pass, and by Lemma 26.28, any other vertex  that is
relabeled during the pass (resulting from a call of DISCHARGE./) has no entering
admissible edges after relabeling. Thus, at the end of the pass, all edges leaving u
remain inadmissible, which completes the proof.
The relabel-to-front algorithm
In the relabel-to-front algorithm, we maintain a linked list L consisting of all ver-
tices in V  fs; tg. A key property is that the vertices in L are topologically sorted
according to the admissible network, as we shall see in the loop invariant that fol-
lows. (Recall from Lemma 26.26 that the admissible network is a dag.)
The pseudocode for the relabel-to-front algorithm assumes that the neighbor
lists u:N have already been created for each vertex u. It also assumes that u:next
points to the vertex that follows u in list L and that, as usual, u:next D NIL if u is
the last vertex in the list.

The relabel-to-front algorithm works as follows. Line 1 initializes the preﬂow
and heights to the same values as in the generic push-relabel algorithm. Line 2
initializes the list L to contain all potentially overﬂowing vertices, in any order.
Lines 3–4 initialize the current pointer of each vertex u to the ﬁrst vertex in u’s
neighbor list.
As Figure 26.10 illustrates, the while loop of lines 6–11 runs through the list L,
discharging vertices. Line 5 makes it start with the ﬁrst vertex in the list. Each
time through the loop, line 8 discharges a vertex u. If u was relabeled by the
DISCHARGE procedure, line 10 moves it to the front of list L. We can determine
whether u was relabeled by comparing its height before the discharge operation,
saved into the variable old-height in line 7, with its height afterward, in line 9.
Line 11 makes the next iteration of the while loop use the vertex following u in
list L. If line 10 moved u to the front of the list, the vertex used in the next iteration
is the one following u in its new position in the list.
To show that RELABEL-TO-FRONT computes a maximum ﬂow, we shall show
that it is an implementation of the generic push-relabel algorithm.
First, ob-
serve that it performs push and relabel operations only when they apply, since
Lemma 26.29 guarantees that DISCHARGE performs them only when they apply.
It remains to show that when RELABEL-TO-FRONT terminates, no basic opera-
tions apply. The remainder of the correctness argument relies on the following
loop invariant:
At each test in line 6 of RELABEL-TO-FRONT, list L is a topological sort
of the vertices in the admissible network Gf;h D .V; Ef;h/, and no vertex
before u in the list has excess ﬂow.

L D hx; y; ´i, where initially u D x. Under each vertex in list L is its neighbor list, with the current
neighbor shaded. Vertex x is discharged. It is relabeled to height 1, 5 units of excess ﬂow are pushed
to y, and the 7 remaining units of excess are pushed to the sink t. Because x is relabeled, it moves
to the head of L, which in this case does not change the structure of L. (b) After x, the next vertex
in L that is discharged is y. Figure 26.9 shows the detailed action of discharging y in this situation.
Because y is relabeled, it is moved to the head of L. (c) Vertex x now follows y in L, and so it is
again discharged, pushing all 5 units of excess ﬂow to t. Because vertex x is not relabeled in this
discharge operation, it remains in place in list L.

(d) Since vertex ´ follows vertex x in L, it is discharged. It is relabeled
to height 1 and all 8 units of excess ﬂow are pushed to t. Because ´ is relabeled, it moves to the
front of L. (e) Vertex y now follows vertex ´ in L and is therefore discharged. But because y has no
excess, DISCHARGE immediately returns, and y remains in place in L. Vertex x is then discharged.
Because it, too, has no excess, DISCHARGE again returns, and x remains in place in L. RELABEL-
TO-FRONT has reached the end of list L and terminates. There are no overﬂowing vertices, and the
preﬂow is a maximum ﬂow.
least s and t), no edge can be admissible. Thus, Ef;h D ;, and any ordering of
V  fs; tg is a topological sort of Gf;h.
Because u is initially the head of the list L, there are no vertices before it and
so there are none before it with excess ﬂow.
Maintenance: To see that each iteration of the while loop maintains the topolog-
ical sort, we start by observing that the admissible network is changed only by
push and relabel operations. By Lemma 26.27, push operations do not cause
edges to become admissible. Thus, only relabel operations can create admissi-
ble edges. After a vertex u is relabeled, however, Lemma 26.28 states that there
are no admissible edges entering u but there may be admissible edges leaving u.
Thus, by moving u to the front of L, the algorithm ensures that any admissible
edges leaving u satisfy the topological sort ordering.

758
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
To see that no vertex preceding u in L has excess ﬂow, we denote the vertex
that will be u in the next iteration by u0. The vertices that will precede u0 in the
next iteration include the current u (due to line 11) and either no other vertices
(if u is relabeled) or the same vertices as before (if u is not relabeled). When u
is discharged, it has no excess ﬂow afterward. Thus, if u is relabeled during
the discharge, no vertices preceding u0 have excess ﬂow. If u is not relabeled
during the discharge, no vertices before it on the list acquired excess ﬂow during
this discharge, because L remained topologically sorted at all times during the
discharge (as just pointed out, admissible edges are created only by relabeling,
not pushing), and so each push operation causes excess ﬂow to move only to
vertices further down the list (or to s or t). Again, no vertices preceding u0 have
excess ﬂow.
Termination: When the loop terminates, u is just past the end of L, and so the
loop invariant ensures that the excess of every vertex is 0. Thus, no basic oper-
ations apply.
Analysis
We shall now show that RELABEL-TO-FRONT runs in O.V 3/ time on any ﬂow
network G D .V; E/. Since the algorithm is an implementation of the generic
push-relabel algorithm, we shall take advantage of Corollary 26.21, which pro-
vides an O.V / bound on the number of relabel operations executed per vertex and
an O.V 2/ bound on the total number of relabel operations overall. In addition, Ex-
ercise 26.4-3 provides an O.VE/ bound on the total time spent performing relabel
operations, and Lemma 26.22 provides an O.VE/ bound on the total number of
saturating push operations.
Theorem 26.30
The running time of RELABEL-TO-FRONT on any ﬂow network G D .V; E/
is O.V 3/.
Proof
Let us consider a “phase” of the relabel-to-front algorithm to be the time
between two consecutive relabel operations. There are O.V 2/ phases, since there
are O.V 2/ relabel operations. Each phase consists of at most jV j calls to DIS-
CHARGE, which we can see as follows. If DISCHARGE does not perform a re-
label operation, then the next call to DISCHARGE is further down the list L, and
the length of L is less than jV j. If DISCHARGE does perform a relabel, the next
call to DISCHARGE belongs to a different phase. Since each phase contains at
most jV j calls to DISCHARGE and there are O.V 2/ phases, the number of times
DISCHARGE is called in line 8 of RELABEL-TO-FRONT is O.V 3/. Thus, the total

26.5
The relabel-to-front algorithm
759
work performed by the while loop in RELABEL-TO-FRONT, excluding the work
performed within DISCHARGE, is at most O.V 3/.
We must now bound the work performed within DISCHARGE during the ex-
ecution of the algorithm. Each iteration of the while loop within DISCHARGE
performs one of three actions. We shall analyze the total amount of work involved
in performing each of these actions.
We start with relabel operations (lines 4–5). Exercise 26.4-3 provides an O.VE/
time bound on all the O.V 2/ relabels that are performed.
Now, suppose that the action updates the u:current pointer in line 8. This action
occurs O.degree.u// times each time a vertex u is relabeled, and O.V degree.u//
times overall for the vertex. For all vertices, therefore, the total amount of work
done in advancing pointers in neighbor lists is O.VE/ by the handshaking lemma
(Exercise B.4-1).
The third type of action performed by DISCHARGE is a push operation (line 7).
We already know that the total number of saturating push operations is O.VE/.
Observe that if a nonsaturating push is executed, DISCHARGE immediately returns,
since the push reduces the excess to 0. Thus, there can be at most one nonsaturating
push per call to DISCHARGE. As we have observed, DISCHARGE is called O.V 3/
times, and thus the total time spent performing nonsaturating pushes is O.V 3/.
The running time of RELABEL-TO-FRONT is therefore O.V 3 C VE/, which
is O.V 3/.

We would like to implement a push-relabel algorithm in which we maintain a ﬁrst-
in, ﬁrst-out queue of overﬂowing vertices. The algorithm repeatedly discharges the
vertex at the head of the queue, and any vertices that were not overﬂowing before
the discharge but are overﬂowing afterward are placed at the end of the queue.
After the vertex at the head of the queue is discharged, it is removed. When the

to compute a maximum ﬂow in O.V 3/ time.

Escape problem
An n	n grid is an undirected graph consisting of n rows and n columns of vertices,
as shown in Figure 26.11. We denote the vertex in the ith row and the j th column
by .i; j /. All vertices in a grid have exactly four neighbors, except for the boundary
vertices, which are the points .i; j / for which i D 1, i D n, j D 1, or j D n.
Given m  n2 starting points .x1; y1/; .x2; y2/; : : : ; .xm; ym/ in the grid, the
escape problem is to determine whether or not there are m vertex-disjoint paths
from the starting points to any m different points on the boundary. For example,
the grid in Figure 26.11(a) has an escape, but the grid in Figure 26.11(b) does not.
a. Consider a ﬂow network in which vertices, as well as edges, have capacities.
That is, the total positive ﬂow entering any given vertex is subject to a capacity
constraint. Show that determining the maximum ﬂow in a network with edge
and vertex capacities can be reduced to an ordinary maximum-ﬂow problem on
a ﬂow network of comparable size.

A path cover of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is a set P of vertex-disjoint paths
such that every vertex in V is included in exactly one path in P . Paths may start
and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. A minimum path

Algorithmic consulting
Professor Gore wants to open up an algorithmic consulting company. He has iden-
tiﬁed n important subareas of algorithms (roughly corresponding to different por-
tions of this textbook), which he represents by the set A D fA1; A2; : : : ; Ang. In
each subarea Ak, he can hire an expert in that area for ck dollars. The consulting
company has lined up a set J D fJ1; J2; : : : ; Jmg of potential jobs. In order to
perform job Ji, the company needs to have hired experts in a subset Ri  A of

subareas. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simultaneously. If the company
chooses to accept job Ji, it must have hired experts in all subareas in Ri, and it will
take in revenue of pi dollars.
Professor Gore’s job is to determine which subareas to hire experts in and which
jobs to accept in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from
jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the experts.
Consider the following ﬂow network G. It contains a source vertex s, vertices
A1; A2; : : : ; An, vertices J1; J2; : : : ; Jm, and a sink vertex t. For k D 1; 2 : : : ; n,
the ﬂow network contains an edge .s; Ak/ with capacity c.s; Ak/ D ck, and
for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, the ﬂow network contains an edge .Ji; t/ with capacity

The Hopcroft-Karp bipartite matching algorithm
In this problem, we describe a faster algorithm, due to Hopcroft and Karp, for
ﬁnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. The algorithm runs in O.
p
V E/
time. Given an undirected, bipartite graph G D .V; E/, where V D L [ R and
all edges have exactly one endpoint in L, let M be a matching in G. We say that
a simple path P in G is an augmenting path with respect to M if it starts at an
unmatched vertex in L, ends at an unmatched vertex in R, and its edges belong
alternately to M and E  M. (This deﬁnition of an augmenting path is related
to, but different from, an augmenting path in a ﬂow network.) In this problem,
we treat a path as a sequence of edges, rather than as a sequence of vertices. A
shortest augmenting path with respect to a matching M is an augmenting path
with a minimum number of edges.
Given two sets A and B, the symmetric difference A˚B is deﬁned as .AB/[
.B  A/, that is, the elements that are in exactly one of the two sets.

an implementation of line 3.

Chapter notes
Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7], Even [103], Lawler [224], Papadimitriou and Stei-
glitz [271], and Tarjan [330] are good references for network ﬂow and related algo-
rithms. Goldberg, Tardos, and Tarjan [139] also provide a nice survey of algorithms
for network-ﬂow problems, and Schrijver [304] has written an interesting review
of historical developments in the ﬁeld of network ﬂows.
The Ford-Fulkerson method is due to Ford and Fulkerson [109], who originated
the formal study of many of the problems in the area of network ﬂow, including
the maximum-ﬂow and bipartite-matching problems. Many early implementations
of the Ford-Fulkerson method found augmenting paths using breadth-ﬁrst search;
Edmonds and Karp [102], and independently Dinic [89], proved that this strategy
yields a polynomial-time algorithm. A related idea, that of using “blocking ﬂows,”
was also ﬁrst developed by Dinic [89]. Karzanov [202] ﬁrst developed the idea of
preﬂows. The push-relabel method is due to Goldberg [136] and Goldberg and Tar-
jan [140]. Goldberg and Tarjan gave an O.V 3/-time algorithm that uses a queue to
maintain the set of overﬂowing vertices, as well as an algorithm that uses dynamic
trees to achieve a running time of O.VE lg.V 2=E C2//. Several other researchers
have developed push-relabel maximum-ﬂow algorithms. Ahuja and Orlin [9] and
Ahuja, Orlin, and Tarjan [10] gave algorithms that used scaling. Cheriyan and
Maheshwari [62] proposed pushing ﬂow from the overﬂowing vertex of maximum
height. Cheriyan and Hagerup [61] suggested randomly permuting the neighbor
lists, and several researchers [14, 204, 276] developed clever derandomizations of
this idea, leading to a sequence of faster algorithms. The algorithm of King, Rao,
and Tarjan [204] is the fastest such algorithm and runs in O.VE logE=.V lg V / V /
time.
The asymptotically fastest algorithm to date for the maximum-ﬂow problem, by
Goldberg and Rao [138], runs in time O.min.V 2=3; E1=2/E lg.V 2=E C 2/ lg C/,
where C D max.u;/2E c.u; /.
This algorithm does not use the push-relabel
method but instead is based on ﬁnding blocking ﬂows. All previous maximum-
ﬂow algorithms, including the ones in this chapter, use some notion of distance
(the push-relabel algorithms use the analogous notion of height), with a length of 1

766
Chapter 26
Maximum Flow
assigned implicitly to each edge. This new algorithm takes a different approach and
assigns a length of 0 to high-capacity edges and a length of 1 to low-capacity edges.
Informally, with respect to these lengths, shortest paths from the source to the sink
tend have high capacity, which means that fewer iterations need be performed.
In practice, push-relabel algorithms currently dominate augmenting-path or
linear-programming based algorithms for the maximum-ﬂow problem. A study
by Cherkassky and Goldberg [63] underscores the importance of using two heuris-
tics when implementing a push-relabel algorithm. The ﬁrst heuristic is to peri-
odically perform a breadth-ﬁrst search of the residual network in order to obtain
more accurate height values. The second heuristic is the gap heuristic, described in
Exercise 26.5-5. Cherkassky and Goldberg conclude that the best choice of push-
relabel variants is the one that chooses to discharge the overﬂowing vertex with the
maximum height.
The best algorithm to date for maximum bipartite matching, discovered by
Hopcroft and Karp [176], runs in O.
p
V E/ time and is described in Problem 26-6.
The book by Lov´asz and Plummer [239] is an excellent reference on matching
problems.
